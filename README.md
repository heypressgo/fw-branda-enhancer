A companion plugin for Branda Pro that installs a clean, modern HTML email template and adds a dedicated settings page with a live preview to manage its appearance. Centralize and professionalize your email branding easily.

## Description

This plugin enhances the WPMU DEV Branda Pro plugin by providing a clean, modern HTML email template inspired by services like Stripe. It adds a simple settings page (**Settings > Branda Email Enhancer**) where you can:

* Upload your **logo** directly from the WordPress Media Library.
* Set the **"From" Name** and **"From" Email Address** for outgoing emails.
* Customize the three lines of text in the **email footer**.
* Choose a custom **background color** for the email wrapper.
* See your changes instantly in a **live preview** pane right next to the settings.

The plugin applies these settings by filtering the email content generated by Branda Pro, using placeholders within the Branda HTML template. It also includes an automatic update mechanism, pulling new versions directly from this GitHub repository.
